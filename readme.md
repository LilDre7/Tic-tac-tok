# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with React

## Description

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using React, where two players can compete against each other to win. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and each player takes turns to place their respective symbols (X or O) in an empty cell. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
